There were 912 warnings in `mutate()`.
The first warning was:
ℹ In argument: `nonref_gr_filter = map(...)`.

! Each of the 2 combined objects has sequence levels not in the other:
  - in 'x': NW_001846686.1
  - in 'y': 2L, 2R, 3R, X
  Make sure to always combine/compare objects based on the same reference
  genome (use suppressWarnings() to suppress this warning).
